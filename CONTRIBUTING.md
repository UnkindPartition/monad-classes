This repo serves two purposes:

* as a reference implementation accompanying the [series of articles on
  extensible effects][1]
* as an actual implementation we use at [Signal Vine](http://signalvine.com/)

While this is technically open source software, I am not interested in maintaining this as
an active open project. In practice this means that:

* this version of monad-classes is not on hackage
* I do not accept feature requests and pull requests. The exception is outright
  bugs; if you find any, please do report them.

There is a [hackage package][2] and a [repo][3] maintained by M Farkas-Dyck.
